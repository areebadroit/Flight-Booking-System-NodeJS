A starter template for Node.js projects with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. This template provides a well-organized folder structure and integrates commonly used packages for building robust and scalable Node.js applications.

## Features

- MVC architecture
- Express.js for server setup and routing
- dotenv for environment variable management
- HTTP Status Codes for standard HTTP status constants
- Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
- Winston for logging

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nodejs-mvc-starter.git
    cd your-nodejs-mvc-starter
```

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Copy the .env.example file and rename it to .env. Update the variables with your configuration:
